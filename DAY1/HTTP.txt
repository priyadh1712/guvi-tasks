HTTP1.1 - It is a hypertext transfer protocol that is text-based protocol.
since HTTP1.1 is a text based protocol, it is easy to implement and debug
it is used for transmitting web pages over the internet. it uses request response model to communicate over a TCP connection(Transmission control protocol)
DISADVANTAGES OF HTTP1.1:

each tcp connection could only handle one request at a time.
it could only perform limitedly, caused network congestion
server cannot send the resources client requested for, it can only respond

HTTP2- it is the same as HTTP1.1 but is a binary protocol that is like a improved version of HTTP1.1 based on latency, effiency and performance

WHY HTTP2 CAME?

It evloved to overcome the issue of handling mulitple requests simultaneously.
improved version of HTML1.1 for latency, performance etc

ADVANTAGES OF HTTP2:

reduces the size of headers and speeds up the data transfer
servers can send resources to client before the client request 
improves page load times
improved user experience
binary protocol- helps to communicate faster

DISADVANTAGES OF HTTP2:

binary nature of HTTP2 is more complex to implement and debug
some implementation uses SSL/TLS
some servers dont fully support HTTP2 due to complexity
the initial connection setup may be slower because of SSL/TLS handshake
